        Hi, I'm Gitanjali Soni, a passionate frontend developer. My journey into
        frontend development began when I realized the power of building
        interactive and visually appealing websites. It all started during my
        university days when I was fascinated by how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        brought static web pages to life. Over time, my interest evolved into
        creating dynamic user experiences using modern frameworks like React.

        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        transition={{ duration: 1, delay: 1 }}

        I love turning complex ideas into simple, engaging interfaces. What excites me
        most about frontend development is the ability to create something that
        people can interact with and enjoy. When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy reading
        about new web technologies and constantly learning to improve my craft.
