# Portfolio - Next.js

This is my personal portfolio built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## Favorite Part
Bringing the project to life with animations and interactivityâ€”especially adding the typing effect and designing the theme toggle. It made the portfolio feel more personal and alive.

## Hardest Part
The Git/GitHub workflow got tricky when setting up the right branch and resolving conflicts. Solved it by carefully merging branches and learning how to handle conflicts gracefully.
